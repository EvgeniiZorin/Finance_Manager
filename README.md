# Finance_Manager

This python script reads "Finance_ver2.tsv" file with information on spendings by date and category, and creates visualisations on some parameters:
- Show total spendings per month (all-time);
- Show total spendings per month (in a specified year);
- Show spendings per month over a specified period; 

## Finance_Manager_GUI.zip

This is the zipped archive of the executable (.exe) GUI of the script. If you want to see how the program works, just download this archive, unzip it, and run the .exe file :) 

## GUI_2.py

This is the main script that executes the GUI. You can convert it into an executable `.exe` file by running the following command in the Python terminal:
```py
pyinstaller -w GUI_2.py
```
